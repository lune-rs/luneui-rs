//! App-agnostic glass UI toolkit: an immediate-mode painter on wgpu, widgets, OS backdrop
//! materials and window helpers, styled after the house look (Fluent/Avalonia; see `docs/glass-styling.md`).
//!
//! lune-ui knows nothing about the app that uses it. The app owns the winit event loop and passes
//! in everything else: fonts, the [`theme::Theme`], hit values (the painter and widgets are
//! generic over the app's hit type), sizes, scale and time. The crate reads neither the clock nor
//! the environment, so frames are deterministic.
//!
//! Modules:
//! - [`color`], [`theme`] (the `Theme` tokens and the dark preset with its glass
//!   layers), [`acrylic`] (Avalonia acrylic colour math);
//! - [`paint`] (the `Painter`), [`scene`] (the display list it builds: plain data and the
//!   draw-order contract), [`custom`] (app-owned GPU drawing inside a layer), [`text`], [`icon`], [`widgets`] (controls, menus, dropdowns,
//!   dialogs), [`chrome`] (tab outline geometry);
//! - [`gpu`], [`blur`], [`frame`] (wgpu setup, backdrop blur, the scene → blur → target pass
//!   sequence), [`dump`] (offscreen targets and PNG readback);
//! - [`material`] (OS backdrop per platform, [`GlassLayer`] and [`Backdrop`] describe the layers
//!   and capability levels), [`window`] (glass window attributes, edge resize, double click,
//!   caption buttons);
//! - [`testing`] (fakes of the seams for tests: the display-list recorder).
//!
//! Values in the dark preset are copied from the house look's `DarkTheme.axaml` and `App.axaml`, so
//! apps styled after it match.
